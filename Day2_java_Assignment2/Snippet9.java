Error: Not a statement.

Why can't reserved keywords be used as identifiers? 
Keywords are the reserved words.
keywords are part of the syntax of the programming language. 
They have specific, predefined meanings that define the structure and behavior of the program.
Allowing these keywords to be used as identifiers would create confusion and ambiguity in the code.
